# Python **kwargs parameters
# In Python, a function can have a parameter preceded by two stars (**). For example: **kwwargs

# The **kwargs is called a keyword parameter.

# When a function has the **kwargs parameter, it can accept a variable number of keyword arguments as a dictionary.

# The two stars (**) are important. However, the name kwargs is by convention. 
# Therefore, you can use any other meaningful names such as **configs and **files.

# The following example defines a function called connect() that accepts a **kwargs parameter:

# def connect(**kwargs):
#     print(type(kwargs))
#     print(kwargs)

# connect()


# If you want to pass a dictionary to the function, you need to add two stars (**) to the argument like this:

# def connect(**kwargs):
#     print(kwargs)


# config = {'server': 'localhost',
#         'port': 3306,
#         'user': 'root',
#         'password': 'Py1thon!Xt12'}

# connect(**config)

# If a function has the **kwargs parameter and other parameters, 
# you need to place the **kwargs after other parameters. Otherwise, youâ€™ll get an error.

# The syntax of the following connect() function is correct:

# def connect(fn, **kwargs):
#     print(kwargs)

# However, the syntax of this function causes a SyntaxError:

# def connect(**kwargs, fn):
#     print(kwargs)

# Using both *args and **kwargs arguments
# The following function has both *args and **kwargs parameters:

# def fn(*args, **kwargs):
#     print(args)
#     print(kwargs)

# The fn function can accept a variable number of the positional arguments. 
# Python will pack them as a tuple and assign the tuple to the args argument.

# The fn function also accepts a variable number of keyword arguments. 
# Python will pack them as a dictionary and assign the dictionary to the kwargs argument.

# For example:

# fn(1, 2, x=10, y=20)
# Output:

# (1, 2)
# {'x': 10, 'y': 20}
