# Python has six comparison operators, which are as follows:

# Less than ( < )
# Less than or equal to (<=)
# Greater than (>)
# Greater than or equal to (>=)
# Equal to ( == )
# Not equal to ( != )
# These comparison operators compare two values and return a boolean value, either True or False.

# And you can use these comparison operators to compare both numbers and strings.

print( 10 < 20)

print('apple' < 'orange')
# The expression 'apple' < 'orange' returns True because the letter a in apple is before the letter o in orange.
